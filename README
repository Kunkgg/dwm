# Kunkgg's build of dwm

Here's my build of dwm

## Patches and features

xrdb

:   read colors from xrdb (.Xresources)

scratchpad

:   scratchpad accessible with mod+shift+enter


sticky

:   windows can be made sticky

stacker

:   provides comprehensive utilities for managing the client stack.

noborder

:   Remove the border when there is only one window visible.

dwmc

:   Simple dwmc client using a fork of fsignal to communicate with dwm

vanitygaps

:   like i3-gaps around windows and bar

shiftview

:   shiftview to cycle tags

layouts

:   fibonacci

:   centeredmaster(centeredmaster and centeredfloatingmaster)

fullscreen patches

:   fakefullscreen

    :   Only allow clients to "fullscreen" into space currently given to them.
    As an example, this will allow you to view a fullscreen video in your browser
    on one half of the screen, while having the other half available for other tasks.


:   actualfullscreen

    :   Actually toggle fullscreen for a window, instead of toggling
    the status bar and the monocle layout.

:   alwaysfullscreen

    :   Do not allow the focus to drift from the active fullscreen client
    when using focusstack().
